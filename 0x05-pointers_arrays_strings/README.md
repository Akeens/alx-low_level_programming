##A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is ==created with the * operator.==

- _File:_ ==main.h== is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.
- _File:_ ==0-reset_to_98.c== is a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

- _File:_ ==1-swap.c== is a function that swaps the values of two integers.

- _File:_ ==2-strlen.c== is a function that returns the length of a string.

- _File:_ ==3-puts.c== is a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

- _File:_ ==4-print_rev.c== is a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

- _File:_ ==5-rev_string.c== is a function that reverses a string.

- _File:_ ==6-puts2.c== is a function that prints one char out of 2 of a string, followed by a new line.

- _File:_ ==7-puts_half.c== is a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

- _File:_ ==8-print_array.c== is a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

- _File:_ ==9-strcpy.c== is a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.

- _File:_ ==100-atoi.c== is a function that convert a string to an integer.

- _File:_ ==101-keygen.c== is a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

- _File:_ ==_putchar.c== contains the _putchar() function definition.
